# Naming

- Follow PEP8: modules/packages in `snake_case`; functions/variables in `snake_case`; classes in `PascalCase`; constants in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; private members with a leading underscore.
- Avoid abbreviations unless standard; be explicit and descriptive.
- Keep filenames meaningful (avoid `utils.py`); split by responsibility.
