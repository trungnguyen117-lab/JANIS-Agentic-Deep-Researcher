# Zen & Production Readiness

- Remember the Zen of Python: beautiful > ugly; simple > complex; flat > nested; readability counts.
- Production-ready Python:
  - Full type hints; meaningful names; no circular imports.
  - Logging (no print); clean error handling; docstrings for public APIs.
  - Modules kept small (~200 lines) and focused.
  - Uses virtual envs; pins dependencies.
- Keep code clear, maintainable, and observable; consistency is a team responsibility.
